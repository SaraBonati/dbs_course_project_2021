## What is our project about?
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the main indicators used to represent economical status, measuring the value of the final goods and services produced in a country. While this indicator may provide a decent summary measure of economic health, it gives little to no insights into aspects such as happiness, education, or physical and mental health.

An [online article](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Quality_of_life_indicators) by Eurostat proposes a set of 8+1 _Quality of Life_ indicators, which allow exploring what quality of life even means and how it might be quantized and measured.

## What is our application?
We created an interactive dashboard where users can select a country of interest and visualize the relationship between GDP and selected _Quality of Life_ indicators. Note that some countries have missing data for some indicators (which will be signaled by the application).

As countries see their GDP increase over the years does _Quality of Life_ follow this increase over all its possible facets? As the economy grows and more funds are put into e.g. education and health, do the quality of these services also increase?

## How to get started?
First, select one of the pages in the sidebar to the left. Each page contains two drop-down menus to firstly choose the _part of the world_, and secondly the _country_ of interest.

On the main pages you will see tables and _interactive_ diagrams for your chosen country. You can sort the table entries by their columns, interact with the diagrams by zooming into areas of interest, toggle the visibility of single graphs/bars in a diagram, show the diagrams in fullscreen, and so on.
