## What is our project about?
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the main indicators used to represent economical status, measuring the value of the final goods and services produced in a country. While this indicator provides a summary measure of economic health, it also provides few insights over aspects such as . In an online publication by [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) 
## What is our application?
We create an interactive dashboard where users can select a country of interest and visualize the relationship between GDP and selected quality fo life indicators. Note that some countries have missing data for some indicators: this will be signaled by the application.\
As countries see their GDP increase over the years does the quality of life follow this increase over all its possible facets? As the economy grows and more funds are put into e.g. education and health, do the quality of these services also increase?  \

## How do I get started?
First, select one of the pages of the application form the bullet point menu on the top part of the selector on the left side of the screen. In each aplicaiton the left side of the screen will contain a slider that allows the user to choose first "part of the world", the the country of interest, and finally a time period to visualize the data from the database (subject to constraints depending on the available years for the data).
